    Set an Echo Group based on a Room's Occupancy

    Example name to give an automation created by this blueprint:
    
    - Set Living Room Occupancy Echo Group
    
    
    Who is this blueprint for?
    
    - This blueprint is for anyone that has Amazon echo devices and only wants to programmatically
    play Announcements, TTS messages, and sounds on those devices in which the room is occupied.
    
    
    What does this blueprint do?
    
    - The blueprint will create a new entity group with a name that is based on your 'Room Name' input.
    This group will be named 'group.room_name_occupancy_echos'.
      
    - This new group will then be updated each time
    your selected Occupancy Sensor's state changes.  The contents of the new group will either contain all
    of your selected 'Echo Devices' when the occupancy sensor is 'On' or it will be empty when the
    occupancy sensor is 'Off'.  You can then use this group in other automations to play echo announcements,
    tts messages, or sounds only when that room is occupied.
      
    - For example, you may simply replace your echo device entity with this new group entity in any
    automation you are running those services. But wait, there's more...
    
    
    Unleash the Power:
    
    - The true power of this blueprint comes after you have created all of your room occupancy echo groups;
    where you can then create your own group (NOT using this blueprint) that contains the entities of all
    the echo groups you have created.  You might assign this very powerful group a name 'All Rooms Occupancy Echos'.
    This new 'All Rooms Occupancy Echo Group' will allow you to play Announcments, TTS messages, and sounds on
    any echo device in your entire house, but only in those rooms that are currently occupied.  No longer will you hear
    six different devices 'echoing' (no pun intended) throughout your house from rooms that aren't occupied.
      
    - The 'All Rooms Occupancy Echos' group is the only group I personally use in my Amazon echo announcements.
    
    
    Prerequisites:
    
    - Must have Amazon echo device entities exposed, via the [alexa media player]
    (https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player/wiki) integration for example.
      
    - Must have a single sensor, switch, or input_boolean setup per room that contains an echo device which
    will signal when that room is occupied.  There are numerous ways to accomplish this.  You could technically
    use a single motion sensor, but keep in mind most motion sensors time-out (or return to an 'off' status)
    in less than 30 seconds, which is typically too short of time to accurately reflect the correct occupancy
    status of a room in most scenerios.
    
    
    Removal:
    
    - Deleting an automation created by this blueprint will automatically remove that occupancy group on the next
    home assistant startup.
